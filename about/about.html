        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>
          PMFTCI School was founded in [insert founding year] by a group of
          dedicated educators who envisioned a school that would provide
          excellence in education while nurturing the holistic development of
          every student. What began as a humble institution with a handful of
          students has grown into a renowned educational institution known for
          its commitment to academic excellence and student success. Over the
          years, PMFTCI School has continually evolved to meet the changing
          needs of students and society. Our curriculum integrates cutting-edge
          educational practices with traditional values, preparing students to
          thrive in an ever-changing world. We have expanded our facilities,
          added new programs, and embraced technology to enhance the learning
          experience for our students. Despite our growth and success, PMFTCI
          School remains true to its founding principles of providing a
          supportive and inclusive learning environment where every student is
          valued and encouraged to pursue their passions and interests. As we
          look to the future, we remain dedicated to our mission of empowering
          students to become confident, compassionate, and engaged members of
          the global community.
